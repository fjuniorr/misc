# Introduction

This package is my way to store three different but related types of implicit knowledge in a more explicit way. Misc functions, Snippets and Patterns.

The main difference between the three is between the level of generality that the concept can solve. Misc R function are the least general concept, and are very much bound to R. Snippets have somehow a broader scope and is likely to be the same across programming languages. Patterns are the most general concept, and most often than not they have a general formulation in mathematics, for me, the ultimate level of abstraction.


## Miscellaneous R functions

## Snippets

- Dichotomize (break a categorical variable in dummy variables)

## Patterns in Data Analysis Code

### Math

- Lag or backshift operator

- Double summation

- Sum of squares and dot product

- Indicator function and Iverson bracket

- Kronecker delta

### Programming

- `nest` and `unnest`

- `pivot` and `unpivot`

- `melt` and `cast`

- `stack` and `unstack`
